Using the Elegoo Smart Car Kit v4.0, this was the code created to program the car to act as a security robot. The main.cpp file is for control of the actual robot
while the facialtracking.py file was used to detect faces and provide an alert. The python file runs on a laptop and connects to the robot via it's wifi camera to 
provide the facial tracking. Files not included can be found on Elegoos website.
